Fork and clone this repository to build a gitbook site for your DDRIG application with the [`bookdown`](https://bookdown.org/) package for R.  (Or download just the [.docx](https://judgelord.github.io/ddrig/app.docx) or [.tex](https://judgelord.github.io/ddrig/app.tex) template if you don't use bookdown.)

If you opt to [publish](https://github.blog/2016-08-17-simpler-github-pages-publishing/) your new /ddrig repository, your friends and advisors will be able to read your draft proposal as a mobile-friendly web page or download it as a .docx or .pdf on a webpage that looks like <https://judgelord.github.io/ddrig>.
