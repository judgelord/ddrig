Proposals must include a proposed budget, which will detail the specific expenses for which the award funds will be used, including any costs associated with research materials or equipment, research assistance, or travel. Proposed budgets should also include an expected timeline for expenditures and indicate whether the research scholar expects the grant to be active for one year or two years.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
APSA Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grants will cover only direct costs for research activities. The grant is not intended to provide the full costs of a student's doctoral dissertation research. Project budgets should be developed at scales appropriate for the work to be conducted and may only include costs directly associated with the conduct of dissertation research. For APSA grants, overhead or indirect costs are not considered allowable expenses.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
The grant is intended to provide funding for research costs not normally covered by the grantee's university. Examples of the kinds of expenses that may be included in a proposal budget are the following:
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  costs for data-collection activities, including the conduct of surveys, questionnaires, and/or focus groups or the -purchase of extant data\\
\item
  costs for equipment necessary for the conduct of the project that will be devoted to the project over the duration of the award\\
\item
  costs for payments to research subjects and/or informants
\item
  analysis and research services not otherwise available
\end{itemize}

\begin{quote}
Along with the proposed budget itself, proposals must include a budget justification, explaining and justifying each budget line. The budget justification should be no longer than three pages single spaced.

\end{quote}

\emph{Data, software, and other materials to be produced in the course of the project}

Documentation on how to use the software and access the data will be avaiable on GitHub.

\emph{Standards to be used for data and metadata format and content}

All datasets will be available in .Rdata and SQL format.

\emph{Policies for access and sharing}

All data will be publically available on GitHub.

Both R packages will be hosted as public repositories on GitHub so that anyone can contribute to their source code.

\emph{Policies and provisions for re-use, re-distribution, and the production of derivatives}

All data and R packages created through this project will be avaible for re-use under the Geneal Public License, GPL-3 standard.

\emph{Plans for archiving data, samples, and other research products, and for preservation of access to them}

Both R packages and most data will be available on GitHub.com.

\begin{quote}
APSA is committed to promoting and supporting the highest levels of research and professional ethics. applicants will be required to provide a statement affirming their commitment to research ethics, and describing the application of the principles of research ethics in their projects. This should include addressing questions around ethical implementation of human subjects research as well as whether the applicant knows of any potential issues regarding conflicts of interest or scientific integrity for their projects. This may overlap with issues addressed in the data management plan, but most issues around the ethical handling of data should be covered in the data management plan. In developing this statement it may be useful to refer to the APSA Ethics Guide and Principles and Guidance for Human Subjects Research.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Applicants with projects involving human subjects must provide documentation indicating that they have applied for or already gained IRB approval or exemption for their research plan (for example, the letter of approval or exemption from the IRB or a letter or email confirming submission of an application to the IRB). Applicants who submit documentation of having applied for IRB approval will be asked to submit verification of IRB approval upon receipt of such approval.
\end{quote}

In line with the \emph{APSA Guide to Professional in Political Science} (especially principles 3, 5, and 10), I will gratefully acknowledge support from the NSF APSA DDRIG and all Research Assistants who wish to be acknowledged in all resulting published work, including replication data and software.

With respect to principle 6. the data and code to replicate all analysis will be available on GitHub.com.
