The `/assets` folder contains some key tools:

- `apsr.bst` formats your citations
- LaTeX is formatted with `article-template.tex` adapted from https://github.com/svmiller/svm-r-markdown-templates
- `clean-bib.R` removes any problematic special characters from a .bib file (e.g., one exported from Mendeley or Zotero)

`/docs` is where the .html, .pdf, and .docx output will appear

`/figs` is where to put figures and where any figures generated will be saved
