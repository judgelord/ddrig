# Project description and research plan

>No longer than 15 pages, single-spaced

>The project description and research plan should provide a full description of the *overall research project*, as well as a well-developed summary of *how the grant-supported activities will improve the overall dissertation research*. The project description should explicitly address the intellectual merit, and broader impact of the overall dissertation research, as well as how the *additional activities* supported by the grant will expand either or both. This should include a clear description of the research question and how it fits into the existing literature, along with a well-developed research plan and *timeline*.

>All references cited in the project description and research plan should be included in a separate citation page, which will not count against the page limit.
